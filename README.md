## Assignment 1

In this first assignment you'll be implementing **_linear_**, **_binary_**, and **_trinary_**
search functions.  You'll be using Generative AI to help with this (e.g.
ChatGPT). So, even though these are fairly straightforward functions to
implement, you may not end up writing much code.  Regardless of how much you 
write, you should use ChatGPT to help explain to how these functions differ 
from one another, what the pros/cons of each are, etc.

Note that the file `assign1.py` has the function signatures defined. In order
to successfully complete this assignment you must adhere to these, and infer
what the names of variables being returned mean.  


Also, be sure to document your code properly by adding
[docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring).
In addition to documentation, be sure that a reasonable coding style is
followed as well (e.g. two blank lines between functions). Your program will
not pass the first checks done by the
[linter](https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/#linters) if there is not
proper documentation and styling.

Lastly, be sure to add your name to the top of the assignment where the placeholder.
You will lose points if this is not done (see grading rubric in Canvas).
